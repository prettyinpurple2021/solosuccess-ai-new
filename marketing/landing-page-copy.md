## Problem Section

### Headline
**Solo Founders Shouldn't Have to Do It All**

### Body
Running a business solo means wearing every hat—strategist, marketer, developer, legal advisor, analyst. The cognitive overload is real, and it's holding you back from what matters most: growing your business.

### Pain Points
- **Strategic Isolation**: No one to bounce ideas off or validate decisions
- **Cognitive Overload**: Too many hats, not enough hours
- **Expensive Expertise**: Can't afford a full executive team
- **Decision Paralysis**: Uncertainty about the right path forward
