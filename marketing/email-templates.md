### Email 3: Tips & Best Practices (Day 7)

**Subject**: 5 ways to get more from your AI agents 💡

**Preview Text**: Pro tips from founders who use SoloSuccess AI daily

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

You've been using SoloSuccess AI for a week now. Here are 5 tips to get even more value:

**1. Be Specific**
Instead of: "Help me with marketing"
Try: "Review my landing page copy and suggest 3 improvements for conversion"

**2. Provide Context**
The more your agents know about your business, the better their advice. Share your goals, challenges, and constraints.

**3. Use Multiple Agents**
Different perspectives = better decisions. Ask Blaze about sales strategy, then get Echo's take on market positioning.

**4. Save Important Conversations**
Star conversations you want to reference later. Your agents can pull from past discussions.

**5. Ask Follow-Up Questions**
Don't settle for surface-level advice. Dig deeper with "Why?" and "How exactly?"

**This Week's Challenge**
Ask each of your 7 agents one question about your business. You'll be surprised by the different perspectives.

[Start the Challenge]

Happy building,
The SoloSuccess AI Team

## 4. Educational Email Series

### Email 1: How to Use AI Agents Effectively

**Subject**: The secret to getting better advice from AI agents 🤖

**Preview Text**: It's all about how you ask the question

**Body**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Want to know the difference between founders who get amazing results from AI agents and those who don't?

It's not the AI. It's how they ask questions.

**Bad Question:**
"Help me with marketing"

**Good Question:**
"I'm launching a B2B SaaS product for small accounting firms. My landing page has a 2% conversion rate. Review my copy and suggest 3 specific changes to improve conversions."

See the difference?

**The 4 Elements of Great Questions:**

1. **Context**: What's your situation?
2. **Specificity**: What exactly do you need?
3. **Constraints**: What are your limitations?
4. **Desired Outcome**: What does success look like?

**Try This Exercise:**

Take a question you asked an AI agent this week. Rewrite it using the 4 elements above. Then ask it again.

I guarantee you'll get better advice.

[Practice with Your Agents]

Keep learning,
