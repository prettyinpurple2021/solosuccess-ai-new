## Conversation Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context

**❌ Vague:**
"How do I get more customers?"

**✅ Specific:**
"I run a B2B SaaS for small accounting firms. Current MRR is $5k with 20 customers. 
How can I reach $10k MRR in 90 days?"

### 2. Ask Follow-Up Questions

Don't stop at the first response. Dig deeper:
- "Can you elaborate on that strategy?"
- "What are the risks with this approach?"
- "How would this work for my specific situation?"

### 3. Share Constraints

Help agents give realistic advice:
- Budget limitations
- Time constraints
- Team size
- Technical capabilities
- Market conditions

### 4. Use Conversation History

Agents remember your previous conversations:
- "Based on our last discussion about pricing..."
- "Following up on the growth strategy we outlined..."
- "I implemented your suggestion about X, now what?"

### 5. Request Specific Formats

Ask for information in the format you need:
- "Give me a step-by-step action plan"
- "Create a checklist I can follow"
- "Summarize this in 3 bullet points"
- "Provide pros and cons in a table"

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Use different agents for different aspects of a project:

**Example: Product Launch**
1. **Roxy** - Create launch timeline and project plan
2. **Echo** - Develop marketing strategy
3. **Blaze** - Design sales approach
4. **Nova** - Review product UX
5. **Lexi** - Set up analytics tracking

### Conversation Templates

Save time with reusable conversation starters:

**Weekly Planning:**
"Roxy, let's plan my week. Here's what I accomplished last week: [list]. 
Here are my goals for this week: [list]. What should I prioritize?"

**Content Ideas:**
"Echo, I need 10 LinkedIn post ideas about [topic] for [audience]. 
Make them engaging and actionable."

**Problem Solving:**
"I'm facing this challenge: [describe]. What are 3 different approaches 
I could take, with pros and cons for each?"

### Agent Doesn't Understand My Question

**Solution:** Rephrase your question with more details or break it into smaller questions.

### Response Takes Too Long

**Solution:** Complex questions may take 10-15 seconds. For faster responses, ask simpler questions.

### Agent Gives Conflicting Advice

**Solution:** Different agents have different perspectives. Use Mission Control to get a unified recommendation.
