### 2. Provide Context

```

### 4. Optimize for Each Platform

**Generated Content:**
```
Two years ago, I was drowning in my to-do list. 

As a solo founder, I was the CEO, marketer, salesperson, customer support, and janitor. I worked 80-hour weeks and still felt behind.

Then I discovered AI tools that changed everything.

Here's what AI has done for my business:

1. Reclaimed 15 hours per week
   AI handles content creation, data analysis, and routine tasks. I focus on strategy and relationships.

2. Improved decision quality
   AI provides data-driven insights I couldn't generate alone. Better decisions, faster.

3. Scaled without hiring
   I have the output of a 5-person team with AI assistance. No payroll, no management overhead.

I'm not working less, but I'm working on what matters. The strategic, creative, relationship-building work that only I can do.

AI isn't replacing founders. It's empowering us to compete with well-funded teams.

### Example 2: Email Newsletter

**Request:**
"Create a weekly newsletter for SaaS founders. Include: 1 industry insight, 1 actionable tip, 1 tool recommendation, and 1 inspiring quote. Tone: helpful and concise. Length: 300 words."

**Generated Content:**
```
Subject: This Week in SaaS: AI Adoption Accelerates

Hey [Name],

Hope you're having a productive week! Here's what caught my attention:

💡 ACTIONABLE TIP
Audit your customer onboarding this week. 70% of churn happens in the first 30 days. Ask yourself:
- Do users reach their "aha moment" within 5 minutes?

Fix onboarding, fix retention.

### Example 3: Twitter Thread

**Request:**
"Create a Twitter thread about common mistakes solo founders make when pricing their products. Include 7-10 tweets with actionable advice. Tone: direct and helpful."

**Generated Content:**
```
1/ Solo founders: Stop underpricing your product. 

I see this mistake constantly. Here are 7 pricing errors that are killing your revenue (and how to fix them) 🧵

2/ Mistake #1: Pricing based on costs instead of value

Your costs don't matter to customers. They care about the value you deliver. If you save them $10k/year, charging $1k/year is a steal—even if your costs are $100.

Price on value, not costs.

3/ Mistake #2: Being afraid to charge premium prices

"But competitors charge less!" So what? If you deliver more value, charge more. Premium pricing attracts better customers who value your work.

Race to the bottom = race to bankruptcy.

4/ Mistake #3: Not having a clear pricing page

If customers can't find your pricing, they can't buy. Make it prominent, clear, and simple. No "contact us for pricing" unless you're selling enterprise deals.

Transparency builds trust.

5/ Mistake #4: Too many pricing tiers

3 tiers is optimal. More than that creates decision paralysis. 

Good: Basic, Pro, Enterprise
Bad: Starter, Basic, Standard, Pro, Premium, Enterprise, Ultimate

Keep it simple.

6/ Mistake #5: Not anchoring with a high-tier option

Always show a premium tier, even if few buy it. It makes your mid-tier look reasonable by comparison.

$49/mo looks expensive alone.
$49/mo looks like a deal next to $149/mo.

7/ Mistake #6: Discounting too quickly

Every discount trains customers to wait for sales. Offer value instead: extended trials, bonus features, better onboarding.

Protect your pricing integrity.

8/ Mistake #7: Never raising prices

Your product improves. Your costs increase. Your value grows. Your prices should too.

Grandfather existing customers, charge new customers more. Annual 10-15% increases are normal and expected.

9/ Bonus: Not testing pricing

Your first pricing is a guess. Test different price points, tiers, and packaging. Small changes can double revenue.

A/B test everything.

10/ Remember: Pricing is a positioning statement.

Low prices say "commodity."
High prices say "premium."

What do you want your pricing to say about your product?
